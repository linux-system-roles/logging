## fluentd/fluentd-inputs

This role configures fluentd to parse the selected logs
and add additional metadata before sending them to the defined target.

For logs collection and processing you can either add a configuration file for Rsyslog or Fluentd or
select from the optional predefined logs to collect.


The following metadata is added to the oVirt logs:

- `hostname`

  The hostname that the metric is collected from.

- `ipaddr4`

  The ipv4 address of the host the metric is collected from.

- `service`

  The name for the collected log file.

- `tag`

  This field can be used for several tags.
  Currently it holds the prefixs of the elasticsearch index the logs will be saved to. Like, project.ovirt-logs-<ovirt_env_name>
