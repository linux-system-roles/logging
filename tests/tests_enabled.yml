# Test to ensure the logging role successfully runs with the no given variables.
#
# [Configuration]
# No variables
#
# [Test scenario]
# 0. Run logging role.
#    If no variables are given, the logging role is not executed.
# 1. Check rsyslog.conf file size.
#    If logging role is _not_ executed, the original file size is about
#    3000 bytes.
#    Thus, assert the size is greater than 2000.
# 2. Check file count in /etc/rsyslog.d.
#    If logging role is _not_ executed, only configuration files only added
#    by other package could exist. That is usually 1 (RHEL8) or 2 (RHEL7).
#    Thus, assert the the count is less than or equal to 2.
# 3. Check systemctl status of rsyslog as well as error or specific message
#    in the output.
