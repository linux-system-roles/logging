# Test the configuration, basics input with use_imuxsock option and files output
#
# [Configuration]
# basics input (imuxsock) -> files output (omfile); it is implicitly configured.
#                            default means using the default rsyslog conf in
#                            roles/rsyslog/template/output_files.j2.
# use_imuxsock: true
#
# [Test scenario]
# 0. Run logging role.
# 1. Check rsyslog.conf file size.
#    If logging role is executed, the file size is about 100 bytes.
#    If not executed, the default rsyslog.conf size is larger than 3000 bytes.
#    Thus, assert the size is less than 1000.
# 2. Check file count in /etc/rsyslog.d.
#    If logging role is executed, 5 config files are generated.
#    Other package could add rsyslog config files such as 21-cloudinit.conf to
#    /etc/rsyslog.d and the number varies per RHEL version.
#    Thus, assert the the count is greater than or equal to 5.
# 3. Check systemctl status of rsyslog as well as error or specific message in
#    the output.
# 4. Check a files output config file exists which verifies the generated
#    filename is correct.
# 4.1 Check if the files output config file contains the expected filter and
#     the output file as configured.
# 4.2 Run logger command and check the log is in the local output file in
#     {{ __default_system_log }}.
