# Absent state test - Running combination configured logging role twice;
# in the second run, some logging_outputs state are set to absent so that the items are removed.
#
# [Configuration]
# basics input (imjournal) -> 2 files output (omfile), 2 forwards output (omfwd)
# files input (imfile) -> 2 files output (omfile)
#
# [Test scenario]
# 0. Run logging role.
# 1. Check rsyslog.conf file size.
#    If logging role is executed, the file size is about 100 bytes.
#    If not executed, the default rsyslog.conf size is larger than 3000 bytes.
#    Thus, assert the size is less than 1000.
# 2. Check file count in /etc/rsyslog.d.
#    If logging role is executed, 10 config files are generated.
#    Other package could add rsyslog config files such as 21-cloudinit.conf to
#    /etc/rsyslog.d and the number varies per RHEL version.
#    Thus, assert the the count is greater than or equal to 10.
# 3. Generate a test config file to check if the config file is overridden in the second run.
# 4. Run logging role again with setting "state: absent" to some items.
# 5. Check file count in /etc/rsyslog.d.
#    If the second logging role run is successful, 6 config files are generated.
#    Thus, assert the the count is less than or equal to 8.
# 6. Check the generated test config file in 3 was updated correctly.
# 7. Check systemctl status of rsyslog as well as error or specific message in the output.
