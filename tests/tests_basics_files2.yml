# Test the configuration, basics input and 4 configured files output
#
# [Configuration]
# basics input (imjournal) -> 4 files output (omfile)
# logging_purge_confs: true
#
# [Test scenario]
# 0. Run logging role.
# 1. Check rsyslog.conf file size.
#    If logging role is executed, the file size is about 100 bytes.
#    Thus, assert the size is less than 1000.
# 2. Check file count in /etc/rsyslog.d.
#    If logging role is executed, 8 config files are generated.
#    By setting logging_purge_confs, pre-existing config files are deleted.
#    Thus, assert the the count is equal to 8.
# 3. Check systemctl status of rsyslog as well as error or specific message in the output.
# 4. To verify the generated filename is correct, check the config file of files output exists.
# 4.1 Check the config file contains the expected filter and the output file as configured.
# 4.2 Run logger command and check the log is in the local output file {{ __default_system_log }}.
