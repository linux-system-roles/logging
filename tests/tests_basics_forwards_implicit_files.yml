# Ensure that the role runs with parameters from imjournal to two omfwd outputs and implicit omfile output
#
# [Configuration]
# basics input (imjournal) -> implicit default files output (omfile), 2 forwards output (omfwd)
#
# [Test scenario]
# 0. Run logging role.
# 1. Check rsyslog.conf file size.
#    If logging role is executed, the file size is about 100 bytes.
#    If not executed, the default rsyslog.conf size is larger than 3000 bytes.
#    Thus, assert the size is less than 1000.
# 2. Check file count in /etc/rsyslog.d.
#    If logging role is executed, 7 config files are generated.
#    Other package could add rsyslog config files such as 21-cloudinit.conf to
#    /etc/rsyslog.d and the number varies per RHEL version.
#    Thus, assert the the count is greater than or equal to 7.
# 3. Check systemctl status of rsyslog as well as error or specific message in the output.
# 4. To verify the generated filename is correct, check the config file of files output exists.
# 4.1 Check the config file contains the expected filter and the output file as configured.
# 4.2 Run logger command and check the log is in the local output file {{ __default_system_log }}.
# 5. To verify the generated filename is correct, check the config file of forwards output exists.
# 5.1 Check if the forwards output config file contains the expected filter and the action as configured.
