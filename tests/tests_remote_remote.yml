# Test configuration inputs from the remote rsyslog to the configured local files outputs.
#
# [Configuration]
# remote inputs (imudp, imtcp) -> 2 remote_files outputs (omfile)
# logging_purge_confs: true
#
# [Test scenario]
# 0. Run logging role.
# 1. Check rsyslog.conf file size.
#    If logging role is executed, the file size is about 100 bytes.
#    If not executed, the default rsyslog.conf size is larger than 3000 bytes.
#    Thus, assert the size is less than 1000.
# 2. Check file count in /etc/rsyslog.d.
#    If logging role is executed, 10 config files are generated.
#    By setting logging_purge_confs, pre-existing config files are deleted.
#    Thus, assert the the count is equal to 10.
# 3. Install lsof
# 3.1 Using lsof, check port 514 is open for TCP
# 3.2 Using lsof, check port 514 is open for UDP
